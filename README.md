2.  Next, it validates search result counts.

3.  After that it validates invalid search functionality with invalid data('@@33444455@33' in our case) and verified correct error message.

4.  Validatd search functionality with data which doesnâ€™t auto populate bu input 'javapaper'

5.  Validated the new search functionality.

6.  Validated the search result page consistency even after doing login /logout from search result page by signing up with email and passwords and then loggin in and logging out

7.  Validated that the search should be perform on hitting the enter key after providing input by creating a bot to press and release the enter key

8.  Validated auto populate functionality with minimum and maximum character with test input 'e' and 'The Desensitisation as A3 Adenosine Receptor Regulation: Physiopathological ImplicationsMaria Letizia Trincavelli, Osele Ciampi, Claudia MartiniPages 75-90'

9.  Validated the input data on search result page by testinh this with values 'sesbania javanica'
